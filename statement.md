Statement of the Project
● Problem Statement

People often struggle to keep track of their daily spending and lose track of where their money goes. Manual notes are unreliable, 
and many finance apps can be complicated. There is a need for a simple tool that allows users to record expenses, 
categorize them, and view meaningful summaries.

● Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a basic but functional console-based expense tracker using Python.
The system allows users to:

Add, view, and search expenses

Generate monthly and overall summaries

Store data permanently in a text file

Validate user inputs to avoid errors

The scope is limited to essential features suitable for first-year learning, without databases or advanced GUI.

● Target Users

Students who want a simple tool to track daily expenses

Beginners learning Python programming

Anyone looking for a lightweight, offline expense tracker

● High-Level Features

Add new expenses (date, category, amount, note)

View all recorded expenses in a structured table

Search expenses by category

Monthly summary of spending

Overall analytics (totals + highest-spending category)

Permanent storage using a text file

Input validation for safety and reliability
