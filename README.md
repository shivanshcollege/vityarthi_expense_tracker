* View all expenses in a formatted table
* Search expenses by category
* Monthly spending summary
* Overall analytics (total + category breakdown + highest category)
* Automatic saving to expenses.txt
* Safe input validation for amount, date, year, and month

2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or VS Code terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the program using:

   bash
   python main.py
   
5. Use the numbered menu to navigate through the features.

#  Instructions for Testing

* Add multiple expenses and verify the table updates correctly.
* Test invalid inputs (letters instead of numbers, wrong dates) to check validation.
* Try searching by different categories.
* Generate monthly summaries for months with and without data.
* Exit the program and re-run it to ensure data loads from expenses.txt
